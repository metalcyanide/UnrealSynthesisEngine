# UnrealSynthesisEngine (USE)
Proof verifier for Unrealizability Logic

# Tool
## Building
To build and use our tool, USE, you need the following software:
- Instance of Z3 for Python
- Java 1.12 or higher

## Running
We have two options available to use our tool. The first is to run the `Program.java` class, 
which allows one to specify their unrealizability proof as arguments to the main method.
The second is to run our testing suite, which automatically collects and verifies the
proofs against their expected outputs.
